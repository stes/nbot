#nbot - README

##Overview

The 'nbot' - or 'news bot' - is a specialised web crawler used to autonomously search the web for news you are interested in. Based on your ratings of articles you read, the nbot is able to classifiy new articles according to their estimated relevance.

nbot is developed using Python 2.7. The first step is to finish a cli application that performs all the background work. After this, a GUI will be added in order to properly display the news to the user in an appealing form.

Currently, nbot is under active development.

##Dependencies

Currently, the following python libraries have to be installed in order to run the application:

* NumPy - http://numpy.scipy.org/
* stemming 1.0 - http://numpy.scipy.org/
